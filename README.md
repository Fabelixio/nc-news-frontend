## Project Information
This is a frontend web project that aims to simulate a news/social media website. It is reliant on a backend database for API calls which is linked below.

## Features
Use the navigation bar to traverse the main site pages.
The article list can be sorted to your preference.
Topics can be selected from the topics page, and will filter the article list to just articles of that topic.
Click on an article to view its contents, from there you can like or dislike the article and leave comments or delete comments by your user.
